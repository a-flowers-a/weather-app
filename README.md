# Weather app challenge

Web frontend app challenge that shows list of weather.

<br>

This frontend app project uses React library and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
<br>

The main structure of the frontend project is:

1. Components: there are all the base components used in pages.
2. Pages: containers where components are integrated and logic for fetching data is performed.
3. Context: there are all the global state related files using React context API, the implementation of each global state is based on **Provider** Design Pattern.
4. Services: in this folder are the files used to perform http requests.
5. Types and Constants: those folders are used to store globally used types and constants.
6. GlobalStyles: this folder stores styles that are shared among the components. **Note:** SCSS is used to ease this goal.
